# Predict Blood Donations

The blood donation process is essential for health systems. Therefore, the ability to predict donor flow has become relevant for hospitals.
Forecasting blood supply is a serious and recurrent problem for blood collection managers. Machine learning can be used to learn the patterns in the data to help to predict future blood donations and therefore save more lives.

# Project objective

This project aims to predict the intention to give blood again, among donors, based on a limited number of
attributes using machine learning

# Dataset

The dataset is from a mobile blood donation vehicle in Taiwan. The Blood Transfusion Service Center drives to different universities and collects blood as part of a blood drive. We want to predict whether or not a donor will give blood the next time the vehicle comes to campus.
The data structure follows the RFMTC marketing model (a variation of the RFM). I will what that means later in the project notebook.
